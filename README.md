This is my Final Year Project in Management and Science University (MSU). It's basically a mobile application for MSU EKLAS platform which is a platform for students to interact with the university's facilities such as learning materials, appointment bookings, exam results, payment statement, etc. 

### Current UI/UX design progress.

### Tech Stack
- ReactJs - Frontent
- Capacitor/Ionic - Turn ReactJs to hybrid app
- Backend - Haven't decided yet, but probably Supabase or plain MySql.
